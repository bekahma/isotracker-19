## COVID-19 Isolation Tracking

### Inspiration
During COVID-19, we've noticed that there is a lot of essential travel done in the case of emergencies. We wanted to create an application that is easily accessible to improve the isolation process. Our mission is to spread COVID-19 awareness, increase the accountability of users, and reduce any anxiety one might have after traveling.

### Features
1. 14-day isolation progress tracking
2. Symptom tracking
3. Blog post platform for quarantine stories

### What's next for ISOTRACKER-19
We'd like to expand our platform and make the application mobile-friendly for those that are constantly on the go or don't have access to a computer. We'd also like to account for user location in order to let others know about people quarantining around them(without giving away user information). Another idea that we couldn't implement but wanted to was replacing the symptom tracker checklist with an AI chatbot that asked you about your symptoms to make the web application more interactive.

### Built with
Google Firebase, Python Flask, Bootstrap
